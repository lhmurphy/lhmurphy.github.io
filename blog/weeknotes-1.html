              📆 <br>
              I keep lists all over the place and they’ve started to get a bit
              unwieldy so I’m giving <a href="https://weeknot.es/what-on-earth-are-weeknotes-a81874c5cef9" target="_blank">Weeknotes</a>
              a shot, as a way to align all my well-meaning catalogues and put them in one place. The idea is to
              reflect on the week just gone and keep a record of random thoughts,
              things I learnt, what I read, anything that I struggled with and, of course,
              the wins. In no set format.</p>
            <p>
              🚧 <br>
              I’ve started redesigning my <a href="https://laurahm.com" target="_blank">portfolio</a>
              quietly in the background. I built my current one straight out of <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/london" target="_blank">General Assembly</a> and did it as speedily as
              I could, with the skills I had at the time, so that I could send it
              out to prospective employers ASAP - I was 6 months without a
              paycheque at that point and feeling rather desperate to get a job!
              Now that I’m employed I can afford a little more time on
              getting it to look how I want, using all the new skills I'm learning
              on the job.

              🌍 <br>
              I’ve always clung onto the idea of becoming fluent in another
              &#40;natural&#41; language. French and Cantonese being the most
              attainable having done GCSE French and growing up in Hong Kong.
              I go through spurts of concentrating on learning new words but
              life always gets in the way. Inspired by the <a href="https://www.ladybug.dev/" target="_blank">Ladybug podcast</a>, I’ve added reading
              the French version of Harry Potter to my bucket list but
              have yet to make a goal for Cantonese. I was born in Bahrain so
              Arabic is another language I would love to learn. When I was a kid
              I had no idea the words ‘shukran’ &#40;thank you&#41; and ‘yalla’
              &#40;hurry up&#41; were Arabic because my parents used them in
              their usual lexicon when we lived in Bahrain &#40;I was born there&#41;.

              It helps me to see learning to code as similar to learning a natural
              language in this way:
                <ul>
                <li>
                  You discover a new word or phrase &#40;a new programming
                  concept or bit of code&#41; that you’ve never come across and don’t understand
                </li>
                <li>
                  You look it up in the dictionary or get someone to explain
                  it to you, whether someone you know or online: Google / Stack
                  Overflow / YouTube / medium.com / Ask a mentor
                </li>
                <li>
                  Then you practice using it over and over until you understand
                  how it works
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

              Listened to the Ladybug podcast’s <a href="https://www.ladybug.dev/20-tips-for-devs" target="_blank">
              20 Tips for Developers in 2020</a> episode and loved it, they
              reminded me of the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank">Advent of Code</a> which I first discovered right
              when I was just thinking about learning to code - I found it impossible
              to understand. I’ve added this to my bucket list as something to
              tackle in the future.

            📚 <br>
              I’ve decided not to buy any new books this year because over the
              years I’ve purchased or been gifted so many books that I’ve never
              gotten round to reading. I will allow myself to go to the library,
              so that I can borrow <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/invisible-women/caroline-criado-perez/9781784741723" target="_blank">
              Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men
              by Caroline Criado-Perez</a> so that I can follow along with the
              Ladybug podcast bookclub. <br>
              n.b. - Perez was outspoken about the removal
              of the only woman from British banknotes, other than Queenie, which
              led to the Bank of England reinstating a woman &#40;Jane Austen&#41;
              on the £10 note, Perez was hounded and harassed online for
              standing up for women’s rights. Her first book <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/do-it-like-a-woman/caroline-criado-perez/9781846275814" target="_blank">
              Do it Like a Woman…and change the world</a> is one of the many
              books on my shelf I have yet to read!
