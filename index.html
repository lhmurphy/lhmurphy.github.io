            <p>
              I’ve always been interested in learning new skills and building things from scratch, meaning I’m most happy when
              I’m making a piece of jewellery for a friend, upcycling a tired piece of furniture or, if I’m really lucky, putting
              together an item from Ikea. It’s that creative satisfaction that comes with completing hands-on projects that
              encouraged me to research a career in web development.
            </p>
            <p>
              While working in the publishing industry, I started to notice a few women around me who were learning to code and it
              piqued an interest in me, so much so that I started to look into what ‘coding’ actually entailed. I was drawn to the
              problem-solving aspect of web development and the fact that it was a skill I could learn, hone and be proud of. I
              decided to find a role in a tech company to assimile myself with this new industry and find out a bit more about the
              world of programming.
            </p>
            <p>
              I took the plunge and joined the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course which was a hugely rewarding
              challenge. With all of the new technical skills I’ve gained throughout the course, I’m excited to finally be able to
              realise the multitude of project ideas that have started to fill up my iPhone notes. On top of these skills, I learnt
              an enormous amount about myself and what I’m capable of achieving in such a short period of time. I’m excited to take
              these new skills into a web development role so that I can continue this new life-long career of coding and learning.

              A two-day pair coding project using React.js on the frontend that
              consumes data from existing APIs: DarkSky and TFL. Implemented
              React-mapbox-gl, Webpack, AJAX, JavaScript (ES6), HTML5, Bulma,
              SCSS, GitHub. My main focus on this project was building the map
              on the page, consuming the varying data from both APIs and ensuring
              that data fed through correctly. This app will help cyclists make
              a decision whether to cycle based on current weather and pollution
              levels as well as show them Santander bike spots local to them.

              and worked on the code for the basket. Implemented Webpack, AJAX,
              JavaScript (ES6), HTML5, Bulma, SCSS, GitHub. This is a prototype
              for an e-commerce merchandise store.

              this was a solo project, I planned all wireframes, ERDs and
              relationship schemas before setting out to build the project. I
              used Trello to organise and prioritise my time. This is a
